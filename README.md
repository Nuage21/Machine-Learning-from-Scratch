# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch

ML-from-Scratch contains my personal implementations of Machine Learning algorithms, built with **Python's Numpy**, Implementing everything from scratch was a great way for me to understand how the algorithms work and I hope it'll be the case for you too.

This repository contains:

## Personal Implementations
- [Mini_Bactch/Batch & Stochastic gradient descent linear Regressor](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/LinearReg.ipynb)
- [Mini_Bactch/Batch & Stochastic GD logistic (cross-entropy) Regressor](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/LogisticReg.ipynb)
- [KMeans Clustering Algorithm](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/KMeans.ipynb)
- [Multivariate Gaussian Distribution for Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Mgd.ipynb)
- [Principal Component Alalysis (PCA) for Dimension Reduction](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/PCA.py)
- [Fully Connected Dense Neural Networks](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/NeuralNet.py)

## Tensorflow (& Keras API)
- [Dinosaur Names Generator with LSTMs](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/LSTM.ipynb)
## Note
I don't recommend using the implementations for any other reason than learning, highly opimized Machine Learning librairies such as **Tensorflow (Keras)** and **Scikit-Learn** do the job faster and often offer GPU support.

## Dependencies
All you need to run the files is python's **numpy**
